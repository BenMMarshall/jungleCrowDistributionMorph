	abstract = {120 species of crows, jays and their allies exist in the world today. Many are exceedingly beautiful in colour, grace and form, whereas others are black and somewhat sinister in appearance. In no other group of perching birds has evolution produced such a degree of variation, from the tiny Hume's Ground-Jay of the steppe-highlands of Tibet to the huge Thick-billed Raven of the mountains of Ethiopia. Some have had a long association with people and appear in tales of mythology and superstition, while others have been regarded as agricultural pests. The great majority, however, remain largely unknown, their only contact with humanity being the destruction of their specialised habitats. As a consequence, more than 20 species are now regarded as internationally endangered, some of which are very poorly known. The 30 superb colour plates by Hilary Burn in this book depict them all; each plate is accompanied by an informative caption page summarising the criteria required to identify the species, alongside colour world distribution maps. Some of these birds, bearing such evocative names as the Banggai Crow, Mesopotamian Crow and Flores Crow, have never been illustrated before. The authoritative text by Steve Madge treats each species in depth, summarising identification techniques and concisely reviewing all aspects of corvid behaviour, distribution, population and taxonomy. The author has had first-hand experience of most of the species during his travels throughout the world, travels in which he gradually became fascinated by this very special, but somewhat ignored, group of birds. Crows and Jays is a combination of scientifically accurate information and an identification guide, planned to give anyone, whether a birdwatcher or biologist, a greater understanding of the lives of these beautiful, yet very complex, group of birds. It will surely be a standard work of reference for many years to come.},

	abstract = {The Jungle Crow (Corvus macrorhynchos) is a widespread species in Asia that underwent remarkable postglacial recolonisations during the Pleistocene and Holocene. In order to better understand the pattern of its settling and diversification, we investigated the morphological differences among adult Jungle Crow samples obtained from locations in northern Japan and the Russian Far East: Hokkaido, Sakhalin Island, the continental seaboard adjacent to the Tatarsky Strait and the region to the west of the Sikhote-Alin Mountains. We studied four cranial measurements and five bill measurements, as well as body mass from 195 samples. We found clear differences among most populations for both males and females when the various characteristics were observed, especially on Hokkaido and Sakhalin Island; crows from Hokkaido had larger bills and lighter body mass. The differences between the Hokkaido and Sakhalin populations correspond to Bergman’s and Allen’s rules, but this was not the case with the longitudinal cline revealed among the three populations from the Russian Far East. In conclusion, our results suggest that La Pérouse Strait separates two assumed recolonisation movements, the first being along the mainland via Ussuriland to Sakhalin and the second along the Japanese Archipelago to Hokkaido. It is evident that this strait is a more effective barrier between Jungle Crow populations than either the Tatarsky Strait or the Sikhote-Alin mountain range.},

This exaggerated feature has received various interpretations, from serving as a sexual ornament to being a refined adaptation for feeding. However, it is also a significant surface area for heat exchange. Here we show the remarkable capacity of the toco toucan to regulate heat distribution by modifying blood flow, using the bill as a transient thermal radiator. Our results indicate that the toucan's bill is, relative to its size, one of the largest thermal windows in the animal kingdom, rivaling elephants’ ears in its ability to radiate body heat.},

	abstract = {Body size is a key measure in many studies. The first principal component using various skeletal measures (skeletal PC1) is commonly considered as the best indicator of body size. In practice, external body measures are used to predict body size, because skeletal measures are hard to obtain in the field. Hitherto, however, external measures could not explain more than 40-60\% of the variation in skeletal PC1. Here we use a sample of 36 Serin Serinus serinus specimens to obtain an external measure of body size which shows a high correlation with skeletal PC1, has low measurement error, and is easy to measure in the field. Stepwise multiple regression of skeletal PC1 (dependent variable) on different external measures revealed keel and tarsus length as the best subset of predictors. The two variables accounted for 76\% of the total variance in skeletal PC1. This was a substantial improvement over the use of traditional measures (e.g. tarsus, wing and tail length), which only accounted for 63\%. We confirm therefore the previous suggestion of using external keel length as a good predictor of overall body size, especially when it is used together with tarsus length. The sum of the two standardized variables can be used as a simple and reliable predictor of avian body size.},

	abstract = {Bird bills possess an important thermoregulatory function as they are a site for environmental heat exchange. Previous studies have demonstrated that birds in warmer climates have larger bills than those living in colder climates, as larger bills can dissipate more heat. Because this dry heat transfer does not incur water loss, it may be additionally advantageous in water‐restricted habitats. Here, we examine the influence of climate on bill morphology in
              Toxostoma
              thrashers, a group of 10 North American species that varied in bill morphology and occupied climate niche, with several species inhabiting arid climates. Past examinations of thrasher bill morphology have only considered foraging, leaving unanswered the role of climate in morphological divergence within this group. We photographed 476
              Toxostoma
              museum specimens encompassing all 10 species and calculated bill measurements from the photos using a MATLAB‐based program. For each species, we calculated occupied climate niche using data from WorldClim describing temperature and precipitation. We found no reliable significant relationships between climate variables and bill morphology across species, suggesting that other factors such as foraging behavior may be more important in shaping bill morphology in this genus. Within species, we found three
              Toxostoma
              species have significant relationships between bill morphology and climate that follow Allen's rule. However, we also found the relationships between climate and bill morphology varied in strength and direction across species. Notably, we found a negative relationship between maximum temperature of the hottest month and bill surface area in LeConte's thrasher, which occupies the hottest and most arid climates of the thrashers. This adds to the evidence that Allen's rule may reverse in extremely hot climates when the bill may become a heat sink instead of a heat radiator. These results demonstrate the importance of considering the generality of ecogeographical rules across lineages that occupy extreme climates.},

The result is notable because, for more than 100 years, many biologists have believed that birds are more uniform anatomically than other classes of vertebrates. Furthermore, assessment of biochemical and geological evidence suggests that the time scale for bird evolution could be quite short. Hence, birds may share with placental mammals the distinction of having had a high rate of anatomical evolution, compared to that in lower vertebrates. The rate appears to have been very high in songbirds and higher primates and extremely high in the genus Homa In an attempt to explain such contrasts in rates of anatomical evolution, we advance the hypothesis that in higher vertebrates, behavior, rather than environmental change, is the major driving force for evolution at the organismal level. This hypothesis predicts accelerated anatomical evolution in species composed of numerous mobile individuals with the dual capacity for behavioral innovation and social propagation of new habits. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrate a correlation between relative brain size and rate of anatomical evolution in land vertebrates.},

              I gathered data on body size variation from the literature and used two general meta‐analytical procedures to test the validity of Bergmann's rule in birds: a modified vote‐counting approach and calculation of overall effect sizes. Related species may show similar body size trends, thus I performed all analyses using nonphylogenetic and phylogenetic methods. I used tests of phylogenetic signal for each data set to decide which type of statistical analysis (nonphylogenetic or phylogenetic) was more appropriate.
            
            
              Results 
              The majority of species of birds (76 of 100 species) are larger at higher latitudes, and in cooler areas (20 of 22 species). Birds show a grand mean correlation coefficient of +0.32 for body size and latitude, and −0.81 for body size and temperature, both significant trends. Sedentary species show stronger body size trends in some, but not all, analyses. Neither males nor females consistently have stronger body size trends. Additionally, the strength of body size trends does not vary with latitude or body mass.
            
            
              Conclusions 
              Bergmann's rule holds for birds throughout the world, regardless of whether temperature or latitude (as a proxy) is used. Previous studies have suggested that Bergmann's rule is stronger for sedentary than migratory species, males than females and temperate than tropical taxa. I did not find strong support for any of these as general themes for birds, although few studies of tropical taxa have been conducted. The processes responsible for Bergmann's rule remain somewhat of a black box; however, fasting endurance is probably a more important factor than the traditional hypothesis of heat conservation.},

              The processes that allow some lineages to diversify rapidly at a global scale remain poorly understood. Although earlier studies emphasized the importance of dispersal, global expansions expose populations to novel environments and may also require adaptation and diversification across new niches. In this study, we investigated the contributions of these processes to the global radiation of crows and ravens (genus
              Corvus
              ). Combining a new phylogeny with comprehensive phenotypic and climatic data, we show that
              Corvus
              experienced a massive expansion of the climatic niche that was coupled with a substantial increase in the rates of species and phenotypic diversification. The initiation of these processes coincided with the evolution of traits that promoted dispersal and niche expansion. Our findings suggest that rapid global radiations may be better understood as processes in which high dispersal abilities synergise with traits that, like cognition, facilitate persistence in new environments.},

            Functional traits offer a rich quantitative framework for developing and testing theories in evolutionary biology, ecology and ecosystem science. However, the potential of functional traits to drive theoretical advances and refine models of global change can only be fully realised when species‐level information is complete. Here we present the AVONET dataset containing comprehensive functional trait data for all birds, including six ecological variables, 11 continuous morphological traits, and information on range size and location. Raw morphological measurements are presented from 90,020 individuals of 11,009 extant bird species sampled from 181 countries. These data are also summarised as species averages in three taxonomic formats, allowing integration with a global phylogeny, geographical range maps, IUCN Red List data and the eBird citizen science database. The AVONET dataset provides the most detailed picture of continuous trait variation for any major radiation of organisms, offering a global template for testing hypotheses and exploring the evolutionary origins, structure and functioning of biodiversity.},

Here we present a method for measuring tarsus length and bill length, width and depth using digital photography with open source software (ImageJ), and we compare the repeatability and handling time of the digital measurements with those traditionally made using calipers. The digital method was more or equally repeatable than manual measurements of bill and tarsus and its repeatability was independent of measurement length, making it especially suited to making shorter measurements. While digital and manual measures were highly correlated for all body measures, the digital method produced slightly higher measurements in all cases meaning digital and manual measurements may not be directly comparable. Morphometric measurements made from digital photographs were possible with a significantly shorter bird handling time, can be completed by less experienced fieldworkers, and create a permanent record that can be later verified, making them a useful alternative to traditional manual measurements of unfeathered skeletal body parts which can be clearly visualized in photographs.},

	abstract = {Taxa classified as subspecies may in fact be cryptic species. We assessed the taxonomic status of the Blue-throated Flycatcher Cyornis rubeculoides complex in India, which consists of several forms with similar plumages and song. We used mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, plumage traits, and detailed song analysis to ascertain the taxonomic status of the different forms. The molecular data identified three primary clades: (1) in the west Himalayan foothills, (2) at higher elevations in the northeast hill states of Meghalaya, Nagaland and Mizoram, and (3) at lower elevations in the northeastern hills of Meghalaya and the east Himalayas of Arunachal Pradesh. The western clade represents nominate C. rubeculoides rubeculoides. The high-elevation eastern clade was considered to be C. rubeculoides rogersi, because it included a sample from this subspecies from near the type locality in southwest Myanmar. These two sister clades had an estimated divergence time of 1.5 million years (my). The low-elevation east clade has previously been assigned to C. rubeculoides, but we showed it is closely related to the Hainan Blue Flycatcher Cyornis hainanus, formerly thought to breed only further east, with an estimated divergence time of only 0.8 my. This clade may represent a subspecies of C. hainanus or, given reports of widespread sympatry with C. hainanus in Thailand, a distinct species, Cyornis dialilaemus. However, more research is advocated, including molecular data, from the area of overlap. Songs were remarkably similar across all taxa. In playback experiments, C. r. rubeculoides in the west responded to all taxa. This is in agreement with recent work demonstrating that song differences and responses to songs are not always a good indicator of the progress of reproductive isolation.},

	abstract = {Species identification has traditionally relied on morphology. However, morphological conservatism can lead to a high incidence of cryptic species, as characters other than morphological ones can be biologically important. In birds, the combined application of bioacoustic and molecular criteria has led to an avalanche of cryptic species discoveries over the last two decades in which findings of deep vocal differentiation have usually been corroborated by molecular data or vice versa. In this study, we use genome-wide DNA data to uncover an unusual case of cryptic speciation in two species within the South-east Asian Streak-eared Bulbul Pycnonotus blanfordi complex, in which both morphology and vocalizations have remained extremely similar. Despite a considerable pre-Pleistocene divergence of these two bulbul species, bioacoustic analysis failed to uncover differences in their main vocalization, but examination of live birds revealed important differences in eye color that had been overlooked in museum material. Our study demonstrates that genome-wide DNA data can be helpful in the detection of cryptic speciation, especially in species that have evolved limited morphological and behavioral differences.},

The acoustic differences are considered taxonomically relevant, indicating species boundaries. Therefore the Jungle Crows of lower and upper Nepal (contact zone at around 2,000 m) are assigned to two biospecies (C. japonensis andC. levaillantii), as is consistent with morphological, ecological and parasitological data. It appears possible to extrapolate the findings regarding call structure to the systematics of other ‘macrorhynchos’ populations as distant as the Russian Far East, and those regarding mallophagan parasites to large areas of SE Asia; regarding the vocal characteristics, however, further clarification is needed.},

	abstract = {Humans are expert tool users, who manipulate objects with dextrous hands and precise visual control. Surprisingly, morphological predispositions, or adaptations, for tool use have rarely been examined in non-human animals. New Caledonian crows Corvus moneduloides use their bills to craft complex tools from sticks, leaves and other materials, before inserting them into deadwood or vegetation to extract prey. Here we show that tool use in these birds is facilitated by an unusual visual-field topography and bill shape. Their visual field has substantially greater binocular overlap than that of any other bird species investigated to date, including six non-tool-using corvids. Furthermore, their unusually straight bill enables a stable grip on tools, and raises the tool tip into their visual field's binocular sector. These features enable a degree of tool control that would be impossible in other corvids, despite their comparable cognitive abilities. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence for tool-use-related morphological features outside the hominin lineage.},

Museum specimens represent a rich source of morphometric data, and for many species this information is untapped. Here we present a dataset derived from standardised photography of museum specimens of Jungle Crows (Corvus macrorhynchos), a widespread Asian Corvid. We photographed 1105 crows, for which 1069 we managed to collect measurements of hard tissue (i.e., bill characteristics and tarsus length). We combined these measurements with museum-curated data on the locality of the specimens, resulting in a geotagged dataset of Jungle Crow morphology. The measured crows originated from across their distribution, representing the most comprehensive morphometric dataset for Corvus macrorhynchos to date. The dataset is a valuable resource for exploring the driving forces behind morphological variation in Corvus macrorhynchos, as well as a foundation for intraspecific comparison of proposed subspecies and interspecific comparisons of other bird species.},
